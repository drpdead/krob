  - name: Erin Willard for Life in Continuum
    comment: >-
      I love time travel stories, and these do not disappoint. There are three stories in this book, "In Whose Time," "Life in Continuum," and "Crossover."
      Each has a different and unique take on time travel, unlike anything I have read before. I really hope there is a sequel in the works.

    comment: >-
      This book was a trove of information, and well written by a 4-time AT Thru hiker.
      It was a good read, and I would read more from the author. The book is a very detailed account of the trail.
      But, of the 50 books I have read on hiking, it is one of the best

  - name: David M. for Timewall Speaks
    comment: >-
      Timewall Speaks is a gripping novel that combines elements of science fiction and personal struggle.
      The characters are well-developed, and the plot keeps you engaged from start to finish.
      Robinson's writing style is both descriptive and immersive, making it easy to visualize the world he has created.
      Highly recommended for fans of thought-provoking sci-fi.
